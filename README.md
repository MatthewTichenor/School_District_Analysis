# Paragraph One
This project is to showcase data from two csv files and create a data summary and chart the trends within the data set. I merege the two csv files and caculated common and important data to show overall how rides shares perform city to driver and rides to total operation. We see a higher trend in the rural area for ride-sharing and low performance in the Urban area. In the ridesharing performance the rural area is where we see a higher average in rides and money comsumption.
# Paragraph Two
I hard a real hard time making sure the data summary would run and obtain all the imformation I wanted to showcase. I knew that I had to merge in seeral areas but fell short in actually sometimes getting all the data into one data summary. I think youtube and working on the gitlab assigments really showed how to really get the data and debug the data. I worked hours and hours to make sure all error were debug.
# Paragraph Three
I would suggest focusing on the Urban areas and see how the company could grow its stats and money flow to match the rural areas stats. The company could always improve and the rural areas are setting the standard of success. I could really use more information on time of services(looking when drivers are earning more) and people ages( What age group is giving money to the shareriding services). Would merge and caculate and merge the new dataframe into the data summary. I would also graph and highlight the trends inwhich succuss and failure within the company.
